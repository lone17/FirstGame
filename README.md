  - Fourtii: for inspiring me.

  - Hat tip to all the people I find while googling for constantly helping me along the way.

# Notes

  - Game's ideal is based on the game called "Tiếng tây tiếng ta" by Fourtii.
  - I do not own the copyright of the background music, all credits go to its author(s) (who ever they are)
  - My code is poorly written and unprofessionally organized so please do give me your advice. Much appreciated
