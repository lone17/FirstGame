# Acknowledgments

  - Fourtii: for inspiring me.
  - Lazyfoo: for making such a great SDL tutorial.
  - The guy on Youtube (whose name I don't remember, sorry): for making the background music which I use in this game.
  - Hat tip to all the people I find while googling for constantly helping me along the way.

# Notes

  - Game's idea is based on the game called "Tiếng tây tiếng ta" by Fourtii.
  - I do not own the copyright of the background music, all credits go to its author(s) (whoever they are)
  - I started making this not knowing about OOP and by the time I do the code is to hard to reconstruct so please pardon my messy programing.
  - Source code is poorly written and unprofessionally organized, do feel welcomed to give me your advice. Much appreciated.
